<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello to all I hope your enjoying what you see,
 My name is William Crudup, I'm from Hawthorne California, I am 32 years old and I have 5 kids, 4 handsome boys and 1 beautiful daughter.
 I recently became  a Web Developer been in the industry for 2 years, I attended a coding BootCamp called Sabio located in Los Angeles Ca.
 I served 11 years in the Army which gave me the ability to live in a few different states.
</p>

<p>My intrest are Basketball, Gaming, Clothing Design, Art, Graphic Design and Forex.
  I started my own Brand at the end of 2022 which is called Crowned Figures. Crowned Figures is a service based brand that supports
  upcoming designers that do not have the time to run a website, market there products of work, create content or can't find clientele.
  Also we have our own appareal line that displays the true meaning of a Crowned Figure. See Crowned Figures is a brand that focuses on and acknowledges
  the hard working individuals and groups that strive to be great even tho they had major struggles and set backs that possibly could have led them to quit.
  See we were all destined to be great in life as soon as we were born but the only way to conquer that Crown was by the grit and determination
  and if you were one of those individuals or groups who accomplished this then your what we call a Crowned Figure "Since Birth", so welcome and enjoy.
